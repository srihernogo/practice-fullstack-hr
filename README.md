Micro Personnel is a human resources management system that separates the front and back ends, and the project is developed with SpringBoot+Vue.

> Because the entire project has many functions and is relatively complicated, it is developed in multiple phases. At present, the first phase of the authority management module has been developed, and other modules are still under development. Considering that the authority management module is relatively independent and does not conflict with the functions of other modules, and the authority management after the separation of front and back ends is a pain point for many small partners, so this project is open sourced in advance for small partners to study.
